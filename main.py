# Explanation:
# In the above code, we have defined a class Dog with the constructor __init__ method. We have defined five methods bark(), sleep(), eat(), walk(), and display(). The display() method is used to display the name, age, and colour of the dog. The bark(), sleep(), eat(), and walk() methods are used to display the actions of the dog. We have created an object dog1 of the class Dog and passed the name, age, and colour of the dog. When we create an object of the class Dog, the constructor __init__ method is called automatically. The display() method is called inside the constructor __init__ method. The output of the above code is the name, age, and colour of the dog along with the actions of the dog.
# The output of the above code is the name, age, and colour of the dog along with the actions of the dog.
